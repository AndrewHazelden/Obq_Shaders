HOW TO INSTALL
==============

  Windows requirements : 
	Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 redistributable package (x64)

  + copy the content of the "metdata" folder into "C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\<Maya Version>\shaders",[Windows]
  + copy the content of the "metdata" folder into "/opt/solidangle/mtoa/<Maya Version>/shaders/",[Linux]
  + copy the content of the "metdata" folder into "~/solidangle/mtoa/<Maya Version>/shaders/",[OSX]

  + copy the content of the "ae" folder into "C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\<Maya Version>\scripts\mtoa\ui\ae",[Windows]
  + copy the content of the "ae" folder into "/opt/solidangle/mtoa/<Maya Version>/scripts/mtoa/ui/ae",[Linux]
  + copy the content of the "ae" folder into "~/solidangle/mtoa/<Maya Version>/scripts/mtoa/ui/ae",[OSX]

  + copy the content of the "icons" folder into "C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\<Maya Version>\icons",[Windows]
  + copy the content of the "icons" folder into "/opt/solidangle/mtoa/<Maya Version/icons",[Linux]
  + copy the content of the "icons" folder into "~/solidangle/mtoa/<Maya Version/icons",[OSX]

  + copy the .dll     in "bin" into "/opt/solidangle/mtoa/<Maya Version>/shaders",[Windows]
  + copy the .so     in "bin" into "/opt/solidangle/mtoa/<Maya Version>/shaders", 	[Linux]
  + copy the .dylib in "bin" into " ~/solidangle/mtoa/<Maya Version>/shaders",	[OSX]

  To use Obq_Simbiont:
  + copy the "bin\dte\dte_2600_64.dll" (DarkTree library) to either "C:\Windows" or another 	[Windows]
    arbitrary directory (AD). If you chose the AD method, you'll need to append this AD 
    to the PATH environment variable. For example, you can add : 
    "set PATH=%PATH%;\\serverX\dte_folder" in the .bat that launches Maya (without the quotes).
    You will also need copy the "\bin\dte\dte_components" folder somewhere and change the path
    on line 30 of the Obq_SimbiontTemplate.py (the "componentLibsPath" parameters).
    If you don't own a copy of DarkTree, you can download some DarkTree files here :
    http://www.darksim.com/html/downloads.html
  

"Core" version :

  The "Core" version contains all Obq_Shaders that don't require additional libs than Arnold's.
  Here's the list of the shaders you won't find in the "Core" version and must be compiled/copied separately:

	* Obq_Simbiont

	
Linux and Mac OSX :

  Because Obq_Simbiont requires a Windows library, it is not available for Linux and Mac OSX.  



HOW TO COMPILE
==============

Requirements:
	Microsoft Visual C++ (Express) 2010 [windows]
	Windows SDK [windows]
	Arnold SDK  [all OS]
	GLM 0.9.4.3 (or above)  [all OS]
	GCC 4.1.2 (recommended) [Linux, Mac OSX]


On Windows, simply open the VC++ solution (Obq_Shaders.sln) in the folder "win_VC++" and build a Release x64 version of all projects.
You will have to modify the Arnold path in "Additional Include Directories" and "Additional Library Directories" in all projects.

When compiling for linux and macosx, please use the Makefiles from within the folders.
Simply change the OBQVERSION, GLMPATH and ARNOLD path before running make.


SItoA ARNOLD VERSION
====================
3.01 = 4.2.0.6
3.00 = 4.1.3.3
2.10 = 4.0.16.4
