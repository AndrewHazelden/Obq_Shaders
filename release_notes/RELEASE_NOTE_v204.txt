This version was compiled on October 30th 2012 for SItoA 2.04.0 using Arnold 4.0.7.1.

FIXES:
	- Total internal reflection is now taken into account in the Obq_Fresnel.

ADDITIONS:
	- Obq_Fesnel : 		in order to have proper metallic colors in a linear workflow, a new checkbox
				was added to deGamma the resulting reflection color.

CHANGES:
	- The bias and gain operations now give the same results as the Arnold bias and gain.
	- Float functions like expf(), powf(), sinf() and cosf() were replaced to facilitate linux builds.

NEW SHADERS:
	- Obq_AngularCamera
	- Obq_Atmosphere
	- Obq_Bend4Stereo

REMOVED SHADERS:
	- Obq_RotateUV ( Obq_TransformUV does the same and more )


Enjoy and give feedback please.
