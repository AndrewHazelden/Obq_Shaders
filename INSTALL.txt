To install:

  + copy the content of the "softimage\spdl" folder into "Addons\SItoA\Application\spdl",

  + copy the content of "Fresnel2Standard_Compounds" into "Addons\SItoA\Data\RTcompounds",

  + copy the "bin\Obq_Shaders_vXXXy.dll" into "Addons\SItoA\Application\Plugins\bin\nt-x86-64",	[Windows]
  + copy the "bin\Obq_Shaders_vXXXy.so" into "Addons/SItoA/Application/Plugins/bin/linux64", 	[Linux]
  + copy the "bin\Obq_Shaders_vXXXy.dylib" into "Addons/SItoA/Application/Plugins/bin/??",	[OSX]

  
  + copy the "bin\dte_2600_64.dll" (DarkTree library) to either "C:\Windows" or another 	[Windows & non-"Lite"]
    arbitrary directory (AD). If you chose the AD method, you'll need to append this AD 
    to the PATH environment variable. For example, you can add : 
    "set PATH=%PATH%;\\serverX\dte_folder" in the .bat that launches Softimage (withtout quotes). 
    You will also need copy the "\bin\dte_components" folder somewhere and change the path
    on line 30 of the Obq_Simbiont.spdl (the "componentLibsPath" parameters).
    If you don't posess a copy of DarkTree, you can download some DarkTree files here :
    http://www.darksim.com/html/downloads.html
  

"Lite" version :

  The "Lite" version contains all the same shaders except for those requiring other libs than Arnold's.
  Here's the list of the shaders you won't find in the "Lite" version :

	* Obq_Simbiont


Linux and Mac OSX :

  Because Obq_Simbiont requires a Windows library, it is not available for Linux and Mac OSX.  



Enjoy.
