HOW TO INSTALL
==============

  Windows requirements : 
	Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 redistributable package (x64)

  SItoA:
	+ copy the content of the "softimage\spdl" folder into "Addons\SItoA\Application\spdl",

	+ copy the content of "softimage\compounds" into "Addons\SItoA\Data\RTcompounds",

	+ copy the .dll   in "bin\vXXX" into "Addons\SItoA\Application\Plugins\bin\nt-x86-64",[Windows]
	+ copy the .so    in "bin\vXXX" into "Addons/SItoA/Application/Plugins/bin/linux64", 	[Linux]
	+ copy the .dylib in "bin\vXXX" into "Addons/SItoA/Application/Plugins/bin/??",	[OSX]

  MtoA (not yet fully integrated):
	+ copy the content of the "maya\metadata" folder into "solidangle\mtoadeploy\<Maya Version>\shaders",

	+ copy the content of the "maya\ae" folder into "solidangle\mtoadeploy\<Maya Version>\scripts\mtoa\ui\ae",

	+ copy the content of the "maya\icons" folder into "solidangle\mtoadeploy\<Maya Version>\icons",

	+ copy the .dll   in "bin" into "C:\solidangle\mtoa\<Maya Version>\shaders",[Windows]
	+ copy the .so    in "bin" into "/opt/solidangle/mtoa/<Maya Version>/shaders",[Linux]
	+ copy the .dylib in "bin" into " ~/solidangle/mtoa/<Maya Version>/shaders",[OSX]
  
  
  Obq_Simbiont:
  
  + copy the "bin\dte\dte_2600_64.dll" (DarkTree library) to either "C:\Windows" or another 	[Windows]
    arbitrary directory (AD). If you chose the AD method, you'll need to append this AD 
    to the PATH environment variable. For example, you can add : 
    "set PATH=%PATH%;\\serverX\dte_folder" in the .bat that launches Softimage (without the quotes).
    You will also need copy the "\bin\dte\dte_components" folder somewhere and change the path
    on line 30 of the Obq_Simbiont.spdl (the "componentLibsPath" parameters).
    If you don't own a copy of DarkTree, you can download some DarkTree files here :
    http://www.darksim.com/html/downloads.html
  

  "Core" version :

	The "Core" version contains all Obq_Shaders that don't require additional libs than Arnold's.
	Here's the list of the shaders you won't find in the "Core" version and must be compiled/copied separately:

	* Obq_Simbiont

  Linux and Mac OSX :

	Because Obq_Simbiont requires a Windows library, it is not available for Linux and Mac OSX.  



HOW TO COMPILE
==============

  Requirements:
	Microsoft Visual C++ (Express) 2010 [windows]
	Windows SDK [windows]
	Arnold SDK  [all OS]
	GLM 0.9.4.3 (or above)  [all OS]
	GCC 4.1.2 (recommended) [Linux, Mac OSX]


  On Windows, simply open the VC++ solution (Obq_Shaders.sln) in the folder "win_VC++" and build a Release x64 version of all projects.
  You will have to modify the Arnold path in "Additional Include Directories" and "Additional Library Directories" in all projects.

  When compiling for linux and macosx, please use the Makefiles from within the folders.
  Simply change the OBQVERSION, GLMPATH and ARNOLD path before running make.

  [New]
  
  - GLM is now included as a submodule.
    Just run:
      
      'git submodule init' on a new clone
        or
      'git submodule sync' after a source update ('git pull')
      
    followed by:
      
      'git submodule update'
  
  - SCons build scripts
    You can now build using SCons if you have it installed:
    
      'scons with-arnold=/path/to/arnold/sdk'
    
    If everything goes as expected, you should have the shaders in a newly created
    'release' directory.
    
    Notes:
    
    - An 'excons.cache' file will be created that contains the flags you passed
      to scons the last time. The values will be printed out, and unless you need
      to change, you can simply run 'scons' the next time.
    - As with make, you can compile files in parallel using '-jN' when N is the number of jobs to run.
    - You can build a debug version by adding 'debug=1' to the command.
    - You can control the warning level by adding 'warnings=none|std|all' to the command. (Default is 'all')
    - You can make warnings as errors by adding 'warnings-as-errors=1' to the command.
    - You can select the visual c++ compiler version by adding 'mscver=10.0' to the command. (Default is '9.0')
      As far as I remember:
         Visual Studio 2005 -> 8.0
         Visual Studio 2008 -> 9.0
         Visual Studio 2010 -> 10.0
         Visual Studio 2012 -> 11.0
