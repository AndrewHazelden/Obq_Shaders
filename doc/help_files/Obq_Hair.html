The Obq_Hair shader is a dual scattering hair shader implementation of
Sadeghi et al. "An artist friendly hair shading system" using Ou et al.
"ISHair: Importance Sampling for Hair Scattering". We&nbsp;suggest
to read those papers if you want to learn more about how this shader
work. The works of Marschner et al. "Light Scattering from Human Hair
Fibers" and Zinke et al. "Dual Scattering Approximation for Fast
Multiple Scattering in Hair" are also strongly suggested. <br>
<br>
<strong>WARNING: This is a beta shader and help file and it will
be&nbsp;updated in the near future. Don't assume parameters won't
change and use at your own risk :)</strong><br>
<br>
<h2>Preprocessing</h2>
Because a lot of preprocessing is required for this shader, two sets of
parameter for the BCSDF (Bidirectional Curve Scattering Distribution
Function) are present. The first set is for preprocessing and are not
texturable. They appear in the first tab of the UI. The second set is
shown in the render tree layout of the node and is hidden by default in
the second tab of the UI, but can be displayed by checking the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Show BCSDF
texturables</span> check box for debugging purposes. Unless there
is a node plugged into the texturable version of a parameter, the
preprocessing one will be used. The preprocessing parameters should
reflect the general aspect of the hair in order for the scattering to
look normal. Checking the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use preprocessing parameters only</span></span>
check box will allow to change those parameters and see the effect
without having to unplug anything.<br>
<h2>Lobes</h2>
There are 4 different lobes : R (primary highlights), TT (rimlight),
TRT-g (secondary highlights minus glints) and g (glints). <br>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Shift</span>
(alpha):
Because human hair isn't a perfect cylinder, there is a shift in the
highlights towards the root beacause. Using the <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other shifts and widths based on
primary HL</span></span>
will compute "normal" shifts based on the value you give to the primary
highlights. Normal values are : alpha_R&nbsp;&nbsp;[-10°, -5°],
alpha_TT = -alpha_R/2, alpha_TRT = -3*alpha_R/2<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Width</span>
(beta, gamma): This is the standard deviation of the gaussian
distribution that controls the roughness of the higlights. The
gaussians are unit height like a blinn-phong highlight meaning that
changing the width won't change the brightest at the highest peak,
which is great for one slider tweaks. Using the <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other shifts and widths based on
primary HL</span></span>
will compute "normal" width based on the value you give to the primary
highlights. Normal values are :
beta_R&nbsp;&nbsp;[10°,&nbsp;5°],&nbsp;beta_TT
=&nbsp;beta_R/2,&nbsp;beta_TRT = 2*beta_R<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Scale</span>&nbsp;:
Like previously mentionned, the gaussians used are unit height and the
scales must be adjusted to reflect the real scattering of the hair. For
example, glints lobe are much brighter than the TRT-g&nbsp; in
"real"
life yet both are unit height here, meaning the scales have to be
adjusted to reflect that (more info in Sadeghi et al.). General rule of
thumb :&nbsp;TRT-g &lt; R &lt; g &lt; TT.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Color&nbsp;</span>:
Scattering lobes color are dependant of the 4 lobes, but the
latter are independent from each other for better control. In terms of
saturation : R &lt; TT &lt; TRT-g = g.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Single Scattering Mode</span>
: You can&nbsp;use this shader in single scattering mode if desired
by checking <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>this
option.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">d_b, d_f</span> :
This is the density of the hair for the scattering, normal human hair
is around 0.7.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Direct and Indirect</span>
: You can adjust the direct and indirect illumination separately with a
scale and a color parameter, but normally, this should be 1.0 and white.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Samples </span>:
The&nbsp;square root of the number of samples that will be used for
indirect lighting.<em> <strong style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">ATM,
all indirect samples are of type glossy</strong></em><strong>.</strong><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Importance sampling</span>
: Compared to uniform sampling, importance sampling will reduce
the&nbsp;noise of the indirect lighting.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Opacity </span>:
The opacity of the hair. You can separate the self opacity from the
general opacity to either fake scattering in single scattering mode or
affect the scattering intensity in dual scattering mode.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Intersection modifier</span>
: This modifies the number of hair intersections during the forward
scattering&nbsp;computation (num^modifier) to allow light to go
furter
into the hair volume.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Self rays between
different shaders</span>
: To check if the rays are self rays during the forward scattering
computation, we use a pointer to the shader to compare if the source of
the ray is the same as the receiver. This works when using either a
single hair object or multiple hair objects with the same material. If
you want the forward scattering to be calculated among different hair
object with different materials, you have to check this. This will have
a small impact on the speed, but will allow this. The only requirement
is that the hair shader nodes must contain "Obq_Hair". So
"Red_Obq_Hair" and "Obq_Hair_Blond" will work, but not "Red_Obq_Hair"
and "Obq_BlondHair".<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Critical Sections</span>
: If things start to crash, check this. There is one place where this
might be necessary, but we never had a crash (yet) because of that. It
has a somewhat low impact on render times.<br>
<h2>Importance Sampling and Multiple Importance Sampling</h2>MIS is
available for direct lighting. Select a "MIS Mode", a "Dual Scattering
MIS Mode"&nbsp;option and enter the desired number of samples. We use 2
separate modes because dual scattering don't really need to be MISed
since it is very diffuse, but the option is there for you to explore.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Note that these sample numbers are the actual number of samples and not the square root of the number of samples.</span><br><big><br>MIS Mode:</big><br><ul><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No MIS</span> : Do not use MIS</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">All lobes at once N times</span> : Do MIS multiple times on all lobes at once choising a direction on a random lobe based on an energy equation. Note that this will merge all AOVs into the primary highlight.</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Randomly select N lobes</span> : This will select N lobes randomly, based on an energy equation, and MIS them separately. This will keep the integrity of the AOVs.</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional lobes according to sampling</span> : This will individually MIS lobes according to the number of samples entered, this way, you can sample only the noisiest lobes.</li></ul><big>Dual Scattering MIS Mode:</big><br><ul><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No MIS</span> : Do not use MIS</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MIS</span> : Use MIS on the dual scattering term. This will merge all 3 DS AOVs into the scatter AOV. When using the "MIS Mode"&gt;" All lobes at once N times", if you choose 0 samples of Dual Scattering, it will merge all AOVs into the primary highlight one.</li></ul><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>IS is available for indirect lighting. Simply check the "Use importance Sampling" and choose a number of samples. <span style="font-style: italic;">Note that this value&nbsp;is the square root of the total number of samples.</span><br>
<h2>Ray Optimization</h2>
To
help things speed up, there is some sort of a ray switch inside the
shader. The modes of computation depending on the ray types are :
color, direct single scattering, direct+indirect single scattering and
like camera ray. The latter is only available for refracted and
reflected rays.<br>
<h2>AOVs</h2>
Fourteen (14) AOVs are available. They
will be added to the list of available framebuffers the first time you
add an Obq_Hair node. You have to activate them in the node's <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">AOVs</span>
tab. A few modes are available and are quite self-explanatory.<br>
